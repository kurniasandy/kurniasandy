### 📘 Education
- Thesis: **Peningkatan Kinerja Metode KNN pada Data Suku Cadang (Studi Kasus: Perusahaan Perminyakan)**
- Research Scope:
  - Data preprocessing (missing-value handling, outlier treatment, categorical encoding)
  - KNN (brute-force and KDTree) + PCA + SMOTE optimization experiments
  - Model evaluation using F1-score, ROC-AUC, and Average Precision

### 🧠 Current Work
- **Data Analyst – Maintenance Mechanical**  
  Supporting maintenance operations through spare-parts analysis, material request workflow tracking, contract monitoring, and procurement reporting to enhance decision-making and operational efficiency.

- **Tools & Platforms:**
  - **SAP** (MM, PM, procurement, FICO integration, and operational reporting)
  - **Microsoft Office** (Excel, VBA automation, analytical dashboards)
  - **Power BI** (data modeling, DAX, interactive visualizations)

- **Responsibilities & Focus:**
  - Monitoring preventive and corrective maintenance KPIs and work-order progress  
  - Tracking spare-parts movement (usage, requests, warehouse flow) and coordinating with Material Management  
  - Monitoring Annual Material Planning (AMP) progress and following up to ensure timely material availability  
  - Managing and tracking service and material contract processes with PT KMI and PGASOL  
  - Creating purchase and service requests in SAP, including service entry and invoicing processes  
  - Verifying Work Orders (WO) and GL Accounts to ensure accurate cost allocation (MM–PM–FICO alignment)  
  - Streamlining maintenance, procurement, and contract reporting using integrated SAP → Excel/Power BI pipelines
